      # On an individual matcher (as shown above) this is equivalent to using

      # Where it becomes quite useful is when using it in compound matcher expressions.
      # It saves you from having to define a custom matcher for the negated form.

      # @example
      #   expect(colors).to be_a(Set).and ~include(:cyan)
