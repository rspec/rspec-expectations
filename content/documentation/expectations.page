h2. Spec::Expectations and Spec::Matchers

When RSpec executes specifications, it defines <code>#should</code> and <code>#should_not</code> on
every object in the system. These methods are your entry to the magic of RSpec.

See "Spec::Expectations":http://rdoc.info/gems/rspec/<%= rspec_version %>/Spec/Expectations and "Spec::Matchers":http://rdoc.info/gems/rspec/<%= rspec_version %>/Spec/Matchers for more information.
