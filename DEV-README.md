## Set up the dev environment

    git clone https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations.git
    cd rspec-expectations
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

Now you should be able to run any of:

    rake
    rake spec
    rake cucumber

Or, if you prefer to use the rspec and cucumber commands directly, you can either:

    bundle exec rspec

Or ...

    bundle install --binstubs
    bin/rspec

## Customize the dev environment

The Gemfile includes the gems you'll need to be able to run specs. If you want
to customize your dev environment with additional tools like guard or
ruby-debug, add any additional gem declarations to Gemfile-custom (see
Gemfile-custom.sample for some examples).
